# Reference guide for GPT↔Local command interfacing

# Basic Commands from GPT to Local Systems
launch telos      → Executes TELOS system
launch thonoc     → Executes THONOC system
launch tetragnos  → Executes TETRAGNOS system

# Example Commands (for future GPT integration hooks)
get system status
get current active nodes
ask telos <question>
ask thonoc <question>
ask tetragnos <question>

# Planned Integration Hooks
> pipeline from voice chat to system calls
> websocket/event bridge from GPT interface to Python CLI
> logging outbound queries to node memory structures
> convert response payloads to conversational format for user

# For future development:
- Consider local server socket listening on port 5123
- GPT sends event/command via HTTP POST to endpoint `/trigger`
- Local system processes and sends response back to chat session

# Placeholder only — not yet functional.
