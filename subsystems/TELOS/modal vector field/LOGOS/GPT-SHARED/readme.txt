# GPT_SHARED: Shared Gateway Environment

This directory acts as a neutral communication channel between the GPT interface
and the local execution environments (TELOS, THONOC, and TETRAGNOS).

Included:
- gpt_commands.txt: sample GPT-to-system communication formats
- Placeholder for future message pipes or webhook relay modules
- Central config files or interpreter helpers (future)

Purpose:
- Bridge between GPT-based voice/text interface and native Python systems
- Enable persistent interaction via command-style calls
- Serve as a shared state cache if needed (e.g., system active flags)

Future Possibilities:
- Local server websocket relay
- Message queue for GPT-to-local system translation
- Output response from systems rendered back to GPT for display

This directory is intentionally light and modular. Add any tools or shared
handlers that belong to all three systems here.
